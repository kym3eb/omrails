<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a newish, working mom.  I used to live in NYC and dress somewhat fashionably.  As my priorities shifted with a new (wonderful, lovable) daughter at home, and my attention towards my own clothing weaned, I've been looking pretty frumpy.  Same outfits each week.  I wanted to look nice for work, but the thought of picking out an outfit and accessories while chasing after a toddler is too much.  I just wanted Cher's closet from Clueless, so that's what I'm working on here with OOTD.</p>
